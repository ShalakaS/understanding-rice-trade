 # Understanding rice trade by largest producer countries of the world.
 
 * This project was created for a class assignment.
 * The prompt for the assignment was "something you miss from home".
 * My answer was "eating rice and dal with my family".
 * The project tries to understand where does the rice from India go.
 
### The folder named analysis-notebooks has 3 jupyter notebooks:
###### Notebook named *data_analysis-rice-India-China.ipynb* will help you access and analyze the data required to draw three major conclusions:
* India is the largest exporter of rice in the world.
* China produces more rice than India.
* China produces more rice than India using less stretch of land than India.
###### It will help you in doing this:
* The data from this notebook is used to create two bar charts seen in the story.
* The data was also used to create a waffle chart showing land distribution in India, China, and Bangladesh.
* It also has ggplots explaining how the rice production of the world is going down but that of wheat and maize is rising.
* This is true even though the number of countries producing rice has increased more than the number of countries producing wheat and maize.

###### Notebook named *new_cleaning_waffle.ipynb* will help you draw two conclusions:
* The consumption in China of rice is more than the amount of rice it produces.
* The consumption of rice in India is less than its production of rice.
* India overproduces rice. Probably for the purposes of export.
###### It will help you in doing this:
* Make a waffle chart showing consumption of rice in India, China, and Indonesia.

### Notebook named *Fixing broken notebook.ipynb* is an insurance policy:
* It exists because the first notebook is very heavy and the main calculation may or may not work.
* This notebook recreates the code in order to get a csv with the same info as the bar charts.
###### It will help you in doing this:
* Run a new notebook in case the first one tries to break your computer like it did mine.
